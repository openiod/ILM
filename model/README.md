This folder contains the metadata for models used in the ILM air quality measurement system. 

Naming convention for these models is as follows:

Letters represent the type of sensors contained in the 'airbox'. Numeric values represents the sub-type. 

e.g.: P1-25-10-UOHT
```
  P   = PM = Particulare Matter
  1   = PM1 
  25  = PM2.5
  10  = PM10
  U   = Ultra fine PM
  O   = Ozon
  H   = Humidity
  T   = Temperature
```

##Datarecord
A Datarecord describes the fields contained in the model. A field is a representation of sensortype measurement or metadata like time or location.
